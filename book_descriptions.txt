9780080491981|0080491987|In May 1993, a cluster of cases of a lethal disease among healthy young people brought the attention of the world to the southwestern deserts. A previously unknown disease was killing up to 80% of the people it infected. The reaction in the area and across the nation mixed fear, lack of information, and the struggles of doctors to save the victims of an unknown killer with hard science and the age old rhythmns of the desert. What came out was the story of a virus that had been killing since man arrived in the American continents, Hantavirus, with deadly relatives across the Americas and across the world. This book explains why and how the virus kills, and why it is still killing today. Why all of the science aimed at a virus identified back in 1993 has not brought a vaccine or a cure is part of the story, as is how that killer virus fits into the story of "new" diseases across the world. The story of hantavirus disease, what has happened since that first outbreak, and what the real risks are is laid out by an experienced scientist and an award winning journalist living and working in the area of the 1993 outbreak. Covers the full story of the recent hantavirus outbreak Includes interviews with survivors, and local reaction Presents the science in lay terms Places the event in the broader context of emerging diseases worldwide The only account which takes the reader beyond the initial outbreak in 1993-1994, bringing them up to late 1998 Discusses hantavirus disease in the U.S., Argentina, and Canada

9780262265188|0262265184|The Parallax View is Slavoj Žižek's most substantial theoretical work to appear in many years; Žižek himself describes it as his magnum opus. Parallax can be defined as the apparent displacement of an object, caused by a change in observational position. Žižek is interested in the "parallax gap" separating two points between which no synthesis or mediation is possible, linked by an "impossible short circuit" of levels that can never meet. From this consideration of parallax, Žižek begins a rehabilitation of dialectical materialism.Modes of parallax can be seen in different domains of today's theory, from the wave-particle duality in quantum physics to the parallax of the unconscious in Freudian psychoanalysis between interpretations of the formation of the unconscious and theories of drives. In The Parallax View, Žižek, with his usual astonishing erudition, focuses on three main modes of parallax: the ontological difference, the ultimate parallax that conditions our very access to reality; the scientific parallax, the irreducible gap between the phenomenal experience of reality and its scientific explanation, which reaches its apogee in today's brain sciences (according to which "nobody is home" in the skull, just stacks of brain meat -- a condition Žižek calls "the unbearable lightness of being no one"); and the political parallax, the social antagonism that allows for no common ground. Between his discussions of these three modes, Žižek offers interludes that deal with more specific topics -- including an ethical act in a novel by Henry James and anti-anti-Semitism.The Parallax View not only expands Žižek's Lacanian-Hegelian approach to new domains (notably cognitive brain sciences) but also provides the systematic exposition of the conceptual framework that underlies his entire work. Philosophical and theological analysis, detailed readings of literature, cinema, and music coexist with lively anecdotes and obscene jokes.

9780691016368|0691016364|Making Mice blends scientific biography, institutional history, and cultural history to show how genetically standardized mice came to play a central role in contemporary American biomedical research. Karen Rader introduces us to mouse "fanciers" who bred mice for different characteristics, to scientific entrepreneurs like geneticist C. C. Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research. It will appeal not only to historians of science but also to biologists and medical researchers.

The pair share a dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie's part of the dream is to be able to touch soft rabbits, as he likes to touch soft things. George and Lennie find themselves on a ranch with Candy, an old-aged ranch hand and Slim. Candy offers to give $350 for George and Lennie to buy their land if Candy can live with them.

Some even consider the mere assignment of a subject to Gill a hostile act. But when the notice "AA GILL IS AWAY" runs in the Sunday Times of London, the city can rest peacefully in the knowledge that the writer is off traveling. "My editor asked me what I wanted from journalism and I said the first thing that came into my head--I'd like to interview places. To treat a place as if it were a person, to go and listen to it, ask it questions, observe it the way you would interview a politician or a pop star," Gill writes. Upon his return, readers are treated to an account of his vacations to places like famine-stricken Sudan, the pornography studios of California's San Fernando Valley, the dying Aral Sea or the seedy parts of Kaliningrad. The result is one of the most fascinating, stylish and irreverent collections of travel writing.

I didn't believe her, and I could tell from the trembling of her hands and the catch in her voice that she didn't believe it herself. When a cat gets into the mousehole, it doesn't go away leaving the mice unharmed. I knew how this story was going to end. Shelley and her mum have been bullied long enough. When they retreat to an isolated cottage in the country, they think their troubles are over, and they revel in their cosy, secure life. But one night, an intruder disturbs their peace and something inside Shelley snaps. What happens next will shatter all their certainties.

9781571431592|1571431594|Literary ombudsman John Crace never met an important book he didnt like to deconstruct.From Salman Rushdie to John Grisham, Crace retells the big books in just 500 bitingly satirical words, pointing his pen at the clunky plots, stylistic tics and pretensions to Big Ideas, as he turns publishers golden dream books into dross. In the grand tradition of Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, Crace takes the books that produce the most media hype and retells each story in its authors inimitable style. Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Margaret Drabble, Paul Auster, Alice Sebold, John Updike, Tom Wolfe, Ruth Rendell, A.S. Byatt, John LeCarre, Michael Crichton and Ian McEwan all emerge delightfully scathed in this book that makes it easy to talk knowingly about books youve never bothered to read or, for that matter, should have.

In every section, we include Before You Read and After You Read questions. The Before You Read activities prepare students for reading by setting a purpose for reading. They stimulate background knowledge and experience, and guide students to make connections between what they know and what they will learn. The After You Read activities check students' comprehension and extend their learning. Students are asked to give thoughtful consideration of the text through creative and evaluative short-answer questions and journal prompts. Also included are writing tasks, graphic organizers, comprehension quiz, test prep, word search, and crossword to further develop students' critical thinking and writing skills, and analysis of the text. About the Novel: Of Mice and Men is the controversial novella by John Steinbeck that follows two migrant workers as they look for work during the Great Depression. Located in California, ranch workers George Milton and Lennie Small move on to look for work. George is lean and intelligent, while Lennie is large and strong. The pair share a dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie's part of the dream is to be able to touch soft rabbits, as he likes to touch soft things. George and Lennie find themselves on a ranch with Candy, an old-aged ranch hand and Slim. Candy offers to give $350 for George and Lennie to buy their land if Candy can live with them. Unfortunate events at the ranch make sure that dream never takes place. Of Mice and Men is a powerful story of friendship, survival and prejudice. All of our content is aligned to your State Standards and are written to Bloom's Taxonomy.

9781571431592|1571431594|Literary ombudsman John Crace never met an important book he didnt like to deconstruct.From Salman Rushdie to John Grisham, Crace retells the big books in just 500 bitingly satirical words, pointing his pen at the clunky plots, stylistic tics and pretensions to Big Ideas, as he turns publishers golden dream books into dross. In the grand tradition of Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, Crace takes the books that produce the most media hype and retells each story in its authors inimitable style. Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Margaret Drabble, Paul Auster, Alice Sebold, John Updike, Tom Wolfe, Ruth Rendell, A.S. Byatt, John LeCarre, Michael Crichton and Ian McEwan all emerge delightfully scathed in this book that makes it easy to talk knowingly about books youve never bothered to read or, for that matter, should have.

At the age of eighteen, Bradley enlisted in the U.S. Army paratroopers. This began a twelve-year period of active duty military service during which he was promoted through infantry ranks from private to caption. He served in command and staff assignments, from rifle company to Department of Defense level, at various stations in the United States and overseas. His military specialties were: unconventional and paramilitary warfare, ranger-commando, anti-terrorist, and cover operations. Bradley is qualified as a master parachutist, underwater demolitions swimmer, mountaineer, aircraft pilot, and flight instruct. He received various awards and decorations for his military exploits. In early 1963, Bradley was selected by the Department of Defense for a sensitive undercover assignment with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Upon completion of this top-secret mission he resigned his Regular Army commission. He was one of the first career officers to voice opposition to the Vietnam War and to speak out publicly against the influence of private and special interests in American foreign and domestic policy. Bradley was honorably discharged from active duty in 1965. He remained active in the U.S. Army Reserve until early 1981. Since then, he has served on special assignments with the U.S. Justice and Treasury departments. Bradley has lectured widely and received national media exposure in connection with his various writing, research, and investigative activities. His commentaries on a variety of contemporary issues are regularly published in regional newspapers. His political view is one of pragmatic social liberalism and reality democracy reflecting an independent and free-spirited personal philosophy he characterizes as “cynical idealism.” Bradley presently resides in the Wisconsin north woods with seven adopted dogs and seven cats.

i9780691016368|i0691016364|Making Mice blends scientific biography, institutional history, and cultural history to show how genetically standardized mice came to play a central role in contemporary American biomedical research. Karen Rader introduces us to mouse "fanciers" who bred mice for different characteristics, to scientific entrepreneurs like geneticist C. C. Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research. It will appeal not only to historians of science but also to biologists and medical researchers.

i9781425980245|i1425980244|A travelogue full of adventure, A Place to Belong is the story of a young teenage boy's search for self worth and faith in a cruel world. Paul Miller was eight years old when his parents took him on a mystifying, zigzagging journey, from Detroit to Florida, to California and back again. His father's tenuous grip on reality becomes as changeable as the landscapes they travel through. Paul's simple questions are ignored or answered by the back of his Father's hand. Paul jumps the roof-tops of Detroit slums, butts heads with the gangs of Los Angeles and gets caught up in a world of petty theft. Life hangs by bus fare, the surprising kindness of a loving family, a filthy motorist with a penchant for young boys, the kiss of a young girl. Along the way, Noah, a wise fisherman, shows Paul that God isn't some imperious judge sitting on top of a throne, but can become your best friend, a buddy you can talk to. " But can such a simple view account for all the misery Paul experiences?" In this captivating and at turns humorous story, a young man travels into the depths of despair and back again to find a place he can call home. "I got hooked and couldn't stop. This is a splendidly written story and quite a story to tell. So candid, unpretentious, and courageous." David Morris, Senior Editor Guideposts Books. "Miller tells a remarkable story, one that is in a sense an American Angela's Ashes but with the added element of faith as a factor in surviving an incredibly rough childhood." Michael Wilt, Editor, Nimble Spirit.
i9780080491981|i0080491987|In May 1993, a cluster of cases of a lethal disease among healthy young people brought the attention of the world to the southwestern deserts. A previously unknown disease was killing up to 80% of the people it infected. The reaction in the area and across the nation mixed fear, lack of information, and the struggles of doctors to save the victims of an unknown killer with hard science and the age old rhythmns of the desert. What came out was the story of a virus that had been killing since man arrived in the American continents, Hantavirus, with deadly relatives across the Americas and across the world. This book explains why and how the virus kills, and why it is still killing today.

There are about 60 living species – all within the subfamily Murinae – representing around 25 per cent of all species of Australian mammals. They range in size from the very small delicate mouse to the highly specialised, arid-adapted hopping mouse, the large tree rat and the carnivorous water rat. Native Mice and Rats describes the evolution and ecology of this much-neglected group of animals. It details the diversity of their reproductive biology, their dietary adaptations and social behaviour. The book also includes information on rodent parasites and diseases, and concludes by outlining the changes in distribution of the various species since the arrival of Europeans as well as current conservation programs.
