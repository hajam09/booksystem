This is a manifesto for how to operate in the twenty-first century, where everything has been turned on its head. Building on the runaway success of Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power (almost five million copies sold), the 'modern Machiavelli' teams up with rapper 50 Cent to show how the power game of success can be played to your advantage. Drawing on the lore of gangsters, hustlers, and hip-hop artists, as well as 50 Cent's business and artistic dealings, the authors present the 'Laws of 50', revealing how to become a master strategist and supreme realist. Success comes from seeking an advantage in each and every encounter, and The 50th Law offers indispensable advice on how to win in business - and in life.

If you have a period you need to read this book.' - Anna Jones, author of The Modern Cook's Year A profound and practical blueprint for aligning daily life with your menstrual cycle. Period Power is the handbook to periods and hormones that will leave you wondering why the hell nobody told you this sooner. The hormones of the menstrual cycle profoundly influence our energy, mood and behaviour, but all too often we're taught that our hormones make us unreliable, moody bitches, or that it's our lot in life to put up with 'women's problems'. Maisie Hill, a women's health practitioner, knows the power of working with the menstrual cycle and refuses to accept this theory. Instead, Maisie believes that our hormones are there to serve us and, if utilized correctly, can be used to help you get what you want out of life. Yes, we are hormonal, and that's a very good thing. This revolutionary book reveals everything you need to know about taking control of your menstrual cycle and outlines The Cycle Strategy to help us perform at our best, throughout our cycle. In Period Power you will discover how to: - maximise your natural superpowers each month while making adjustments for the darker days, and use Maisie's favourite tips to improve them - identify your personal patterns, powers and pitfalls for each phase of the menstrual cycle - plan your month to perform at your best in all aspects of your life - figure out if you have a hormonal imbalance and what to do about it. Period Power is a no-nonsense guide with all the tools you need to improve your menstrual health.

The contested ideas behind world development are explained, with illustrative material, sensitive to place and time, chiefly drawn from Asia, Africa and Latin America.
