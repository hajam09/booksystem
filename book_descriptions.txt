9780080491981|0080491987|In May 1993, a cluster of cases of a lethal disease among healthy young people brought the attention of the world to the southwestern deserts. A previously unknown disease was killing up to 80% of the people it infected. The reaction in the area and across the nation mixed fear, lack of information, and the struggles of doctors to save the victims of an unknown killer with hard science and the age old rhythmns of the desert. What came out was the story of a virus that had been killing since man arrived in the American continents, Hantavirus, with deadly relatives across the Americas and across the world. This book explains why and how the virus kills, and why it is still killing today. Why all of the science aimed at a virus identified back in 1993 has not brought a vaccine or a cure is part of the story, as is how that killer virus fits into the story of "new" diseases across the world. The story of hantavirus disease, what has happened since that first outbreak, and what the real risks are is laid out by an experienced scientist and an award winning journalist living and working in the area of the 1993 outbreak. Covers the full story of the recent hantavirus outbreak Includes interviews with survivors, and local reaction Presents the science in lay terms Places the event in the broader context of emerging diseases worldwide The only account which takes the reader beyond the initial outbreak in 1993-1994, bringing them up to late 1998 Discusses hantavirus disease in the U.S., Argentina, and Canada

9780262265188|0262265184|The Parallax View is Slavoj Žižek's most substantial theoretical work to appear in many years; Žižek himself describes it as his magnum opus. Parallax can be defined as the apparent displacement of an object, caused by a change in observational position. Žižek is interested in the "parallax gap" separating two points between which no synthesis or mediation is possible, linked by an "impossible short circuit" of levels that can never meet. From this consideration of parallax, Žižek begins a rehabilitation of dialectical materialism.Modes of parallax can be seen in different domains of today's theory, from the wave-particle duality in quantum physics to the parallax of the unconscious in Freudian psychoanalysis between interpretations of the formation of the unconscious and theories of drives. In The Parallax View, Žižek, with his usual astonishing erudition, focuses on three main modes of parallax: the ontological difference, the ultimate parallax that conditions our very access to reality; the scientific parallax, the irreducible gap between the phenomenal experience of reality and its scientific explanation, which reaches its apogee in today's brain sciences (according to which "nobody is home" in the skull, just stacks of brain meat -- a condition Žižek calls "the unbearable lightness of being no one"); and the political parallax, the social antagonism that allows for no common ground. Between his discussions of these three modes, Žižek offers interludes that deal with more specific topics -- including an ethical act in a novel by Henry James and anti-anti-Semitism.The Parallax View not only expands Žižek's Lacanian-Hegelian approach to new domains (notably cognitive brain sciences) but also provides the systematic exposition of the conceptual framework that underlies his entire work. Philosophical and theological analysis, detailed readings of literature, cinema, and music coexist with lively anecdotes and obscene jokes.

9780691016368|0691016364|Making Mice blends scientific biography, institutional history, and cultural history to show how genetically standardized mice came to play a central role in contemporary American biomedical research. Karen Rader introduces us to mouse "fanciers" who bred mice for different characteristics, to scientific entrepreneurs like geneticist C. C. Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research. It will appeal not only to historians of science but also to biologists and medical researchers.

The pair share a dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie's part of the dream is to be able to touch soft rabbits, as he likes to touch soft things. George and Lennie find themselves on a ranch with Candy, an old-aged ranch hand and Slim. Candy offers to give $350 for George and Lennie to buy their land if Candy can live with them.

Some even consider the mere assignment of a subject to Gill a hostile act. But when the notice "AA GILL IS AWAY" runs in the Sunday Times of London, the city can rest peacefully in the knowledge that the writer is off traveling. "My editor asked me what I wanted from journalism and I said the first thing that came into my head--I'd like to interview places. To treat a place as if it were a person, to go and listen to it, ask it questions, observe it the way you would interview a politician or a pop star," Gill writes. Upon his return, readers are treated to an account of his vacations to places like famine-stricken Sudan, the pornography studios of California's San Fernando Valley, the dying Aral Sea or the seedy parts of Kaliningrad. The result is one of the most fascinating, stylish and irreverent collections of travel writing.

I didn't believe her, and I could tell from the trembling of her hands and the catch in her voice that she didn't believe it herself. When a cat gets into the mousehole, it doesn't go away leaving the mice unharmed. I knew how this story was going to end. Shelley and her mum have been bullied long enough. When they retreat to an isolated cottage in the country, they think their troubles are over, and they revel in their cosy, secure life. But one night, an intruder disturbs their peace and something inside Shelley snaps. What happens next will shatter all their certainties.

9781571431592|1571431594|Literary ombudsman John Crace never met an important book he didnt like to deconstruct.From Salman Rushdie to John Grisham, Crace retells the big books in just 500 bitingly satirical words, pointing his pen at the clunky plots, stylistic tics and pretensions to Big Ideas, as he turns publishers golden dream books into dross. In the grand tradition of Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, Crace takes the books that produce the most media hype and retells each story in its authors inimitable style. Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Margaret Drabble, Paul Auster, Alice Sebold, John Updike, Tom Wolfe, Ruth Rendell, A.S. Byatt, John LeCarre, Michael Crichton and Ian McEwan all emerge delightfully scathed in this book that makes it easy to talk knowingly about books youve never bothered to read or, for that matter, should have.

In every section, we include Before You Read and After You Read questions. The Before You Read activities prepare students for reading by setting a purpose for reading. They stimulate background knowledge and experience, and guide students to make connections between what they know and what they will learn. The After You Read activities check students' comprehension and extend their learning. Students are asked to give thoughtful consideration of the text through creative and evaluative short-answer questions and journal prompts. Also included are writing tasks, graphic organizers, comprehension quiz, test prep, word search, and crossword to further develop students' critical thinking and writing skills, and analysis of the text. About the Novel: Of Mice and Men is the controversial novella by John Steinbeck that follows two migrant workers as they look for work during the Great Depression. Located in California, ranch workers George Milton and Lennie Small move on to look for work. George is lean and intelligent, while Lennie is large and strong. The pair share a dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie's part of the dream is to be able to touch soft rabbits, as he likes to touch soft things. George and Lennie find themselves on a ranch with Candy, an old-aged ranch hand and Slim. Candy offers to give $350 for George and Lennie to buy their land if Candy can live with them. Unfortunate events at the ranch make sure that dream never takes place. Of Mice and Men is a powerful story of friendship, survival and prejudice. All of our content is aligned to your State Standards and are written to Bloom's Taxonomy.

9781571431592|1571431594|Literary ombudsman John Crace never met an important book he didnt like to deconstruct.From Salman Rushdie to John Grisham, Crace retells the big books in just 500 bitingly satirical words, pointing his pen at the clunky plots, stylistic tics and pretensions to Big Ideas, as he turns publishers golden dream books into dross. In the grand tradition of Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, Crace takes the books that produce the most media hype and retells each story in its authors inimitable style. Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Margaret Drabble, Paul Auster, Alice Sebold, John Updike, Tom Wolfe, Ruth Rendell, A.S. Byatt, John LeCarre, Michael Crichton and Ian McEwan all emerge delightfully scathed in this book that makes it easy to talk knowingly about books youve never bothered to read or, for that matter, should have.

At the age of eighteen, Bradley enlisted in the U.S. Army paratroopers. This began a twelve-year period of active duty military service during which he was promoted through infantry ranks from private to caption. He served in command and staff assignments, from rifle company to Department of Defense level, at various stations in the United States and overseas. His military specialties were: unconventional and paramilitary warfare, ranger-commando, anti-terrorist, and cover operations. Bradley is qualified as a master parachutist, underwater demolitions swimmer, mountaineer, aircraft pilot, and flight instruct. He received various awards and decorations for his military exploits. In early 1963, Bradley was selected by the Department of Defense for a sensitive undercover assignment with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Upon completion of this top-secret mission he resigned his Regular Army commission. He was one of the first career officers to voice opposition to the Vietnam War and to speak out publicly against the influence of private and special interests in American foreign and domestic policy. Bradley was honorably discharged from active duty in 1965. He remained active in the U.S. Army Reserve until early 1981. Since then, he has served on special assignments with the U.S. Justice and Treasury departments. Bradley has lectured widely and received national media exposure in connection with his various writing, research, and investigative activities. His commentaries on a variety of contemporary issues are regularly published in regional newspapers. His political view is one of pragmatic social liberalism and reality democracy reflecting an independent and free-spirited personal philosophy he characterizes as “cynical idealism.” Bradley presently resides in the Wisconsin north woods with seven adopted dogs and seven cats.

i9781425980245|i1425980244|A travelogue full of adventure, A Place to Belong is the story of a young teenage boy's search for self worth and faith in a cruel world. Paul Miller was eight years old when his parents took him on a mystifying, zigzagging journey, from Detroit to Florida, to California and back again. His father's tenuous grip on reality becomes as changeable as the landscapes they travel through. Paul's simple questions are ignored or answered by the back of his Father's hand. Paul jumps the roof-tops of Detroit slums, butts heads with the gangs of Los Angeles and gets caught up in a world of petty theft. Life hangs by bus fare, the surprising kindness of a loving family, a filthy motorist with a penchant for young boys, the kiss of a young girl. Along the way, Noah, a wise fisherman, shows Paul that God isn't some imperious judge sitting on top of a throne, but can become your best friend, a buddy you can talk to. " But can such a simple view account for all the misery Paul experiences?" In this captivating and at turns humorous story, a young man travels into the depths of despair and back again to find a place he can call home. "I got hooked and couldn't stop. This is a splendidly written story and quite a story to tell. So candid, unpretentious, and courageous." David Morris, Senior Editor Guideposts Books. "Miller tells a remarkable story, one that is in a sense an American Angela's Ashes but with the added element of faith as a factor in surviving an incredibly rough childhood."

A previously unknown disease was killing up to 80% of the people it infected. The reaction in the area and across the nation mixed fear, lack of information, and the struggles of doctors to save the victims of an unknown killer with hard science and the age old rhythmns of the desert. What came out was the story of a virus that had been killing since man arrived in the American continents, Hantavirus, with deadly relatives across the Americas and across the world.

Why all of the science aimed at a virus identified back in 1993 has not brought a vaccine or a cure is part of the story, as is how that killer virus fits into the story of "new" diseases across the world. The story of hantavirus disease, what has happened since that first outbreak, and what the real risks are is laid out by an experienced scientist and an award winning journalist living and working in the area of the 1993 outbreak.

It is a cultural phenomenon in which our young people are greatly immersed. Fact 2... Young people aged 9-13 are a massively under-resourced age group in churches. Spanning the ‘tweenager’ and ‘tweenie’ age zones young people of this age are increasingly fashion-aware, media-savvy and worldly-wise.

These parallels allow you to explore Christian concepts with your young people and engage with the Christian faith through the themes demonstrated – from complex subjects such as Sacrifice and Mercy, to everyday issues such as Fitting in and Boasting – with an introduction to the book covering all you need to consider in terms of health and safety, child protection, and how to handle the aspects of Harry Potter that are not always very godly.Mixing it up with Harry Potter will help young people to delight in their faith and encourage them to see that a relationship with God is even more enchanting than a visit to Hogwarts!Each session is divided into five parts and includes photocopiable material: · Beforehand (to help leaders prepare the session)· Opening Activity (introducing the session to the young people in an interactive and fun format)· Film Clip (a short clip from one of the Harry Potter films)· Taking It Further (developing the theme and exploring it in greater depth)· Bible Focus (a Bible verse that deals with the Christian perspective of the theme)· Prayer Response (prayer activity drawing on the theme and giving space for response)

9780520065437|0520065433|Vietnam was America's most divisive and unsuccessful foreign war. It was also the first to be televised and the first of the modern era fought without military censorship. From the earliest days of the Kennedy-Johnson escalation right up to the American withdrawal, and even today, the media's role in Vietnam has continued to be intensely controversial. The "Uncensored War" gives a richly detailed account of what Americans read and watched about Vietnam. Hallin draws on the complete body of the New York Times coverage from 1961 to 1965, a sample of hundreds of television reports from 1965-73, including television coverage filmed by the Defense Department in the early years of the war, and interviews with many of the journalists who reported it, to give a powerful critique of the conventional wisdom, both conservative and liberal, about the media and Vietnam. Far from being a consistent adversary of government policy in Vietnam, Hallin shows, the media were closely tied to official perspectives throughout the war, though divisions in the government itself and contradictions in its public relations policies caused every administration, at certain times, to lose its ability to "manage" the news effectively. As for television, it neither showed the "literal horror of war," nor did it play a leading role in the collapse of support: it presented a highly idealized picture of the war in the early years, and shifted toward a more critical view only after public unhappiness and elite divisions over the war were well advanced.

9780745634272|0745634273|This is an exciting new edition of R. W. Connell s ground-breaking text, which has become a classic work on the nature and construction of masculine identity. Connell argues that there is not one masculinity, but many different masculinities, each associated with different positions of power. In a world gender order that continues to privilege men over women, but also raises difficult issues for men and boys, Connell s account is more pertinent than ever before. In a substantial new introduction and conclusion, Connell discusses the development of masculinity studies in the ten years since the book s initial publication. The book explores global gender relations, new theories, and practical uses of masculinity research. Looking to the future, a new concluding chapter addresses the politics of masculinities, and the implications of masculinity research for understanding current world issues. Against the backdrop of an increasingly divided world, dominated by neo-conservative politics, Connell s account highlights a series of compelling questions about the future of human society. This second edition of Connell s classic book will be essential reading for students taking courses on masculinities and gender studies, and will be of interest to students and scholars across the humanities and social sciences.

The pair share a dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie's part of the dream is to be able to touch soft rabbits, as he likes to touch soft things. George and Lennie find themselves on a ranch with Candy, an old-aged ranch hand and Slim. Candy offers to give $350 for George and Lennie to buy their land if Candy can live with them.

What started as a fun personal project quickly escalated into something bigger. This is a short novella, about half the length of an average book and does not fit into the Among the Dead series. "Originally published in 1937 by John Steinbeck, reimagined and corrupted by Ryan Colley in 2018 for this satirical novella. George Milton, an intelligent and quick witted survivor, and Lennie Small, a physically strong but intellectually challenged childlike individual, are two displaced ranch workers fleeing the apocalypse. Forced to move from place to place, partially due to Lennie's misdeeds and mainly due to the undead roaming the land. They both search for work in a collapsing world in an attempt to buy their own corner of heaven where they will be safe together from the "Sick Ones" and "live off the fatta the lan." For fans of the original novel, apocalypse fiction, or for those looking for something different."

There are about 60 living species – all within the subfamily Murinae – representing around 25 per cent of all species of Australian mammals. They range in size from the very small delicate mouse to the highly specialised, arid-adapted hopping mouse, the large tree rat and the carnivorous water rat. Native Mice and Rats describes the evolution and ecology of this much-neglected group of animals. It details the diversity of their reproductive biology, their dietary adaptations and social behaviour. The book also includes information on rodent parasites and diseases, and concludes by outlining the changes in distribution of the various species since the arrival of Europeans as well as current conservation programs.

9781412067102|1412067103|You can realize your dreams! After all, as a man thinks in his heart, so he is--is the place of your dreams not in your own heart? However, the big question is, have you ever had a great dream in the day with your eyes wide open? If not, has one ever been revealed to you in your sleep? My dear, what have you done to, and with your dreams? Did you transform them into creative physical thinking, or did you allow someone to successfully lie to you that such dreams are signs of an impending illness? Usually in a place like Africa, when men dream great dreams, they are accused of having a bout of malaria. But the sheer truth is, only men who have dreamt great dreams have also turned out to be "great" in life--only nations who have dreamt great dreams have also turned out to be great in the committee of nations. Martin Luther-King Jnr. once had a dream; Bill Gates also, definitely did have a dream; and today, I have a new dream--that you, can become the man or woman of your own dreams--the happy millionaire, the quintessential preacher, the excellent career person, the best athlete, the music star, the banker par excellence, name it--you can be whatever you want to be. Basically, A Fantastic Cruise To The Zenith is an excellent allegorical guide to the place of your dreams--wherever it is. But beyond that, it also guides you to a point of new discovery--the Zenith: the state of assured eternal security, the realm of abundance, and the regime of highest achievements. I count you rather blessed and favored to behold this divinely inspired message received in line with my vision to strengthen people, especially, my generation, and those yet to come. It is a book of life designed to answer to the needs of many--from all cadres, and from all ages--it will answer to your very need. The writing style is absolutely unique, and essentially focused on general readership, but with a systematic attempt to assert the symptomatic beauty of excellent living; demystify the concept of human destiny; construct a fulcrum for achieving a healthier, happier, and more successful human life here on earth and, a profitable eternal life for the soul even after the "first death." A Fantastic Cruise To The Zenith also makes strong reference to my theory of the Democratic Human Tripod, which is an elegant attempt to explain the tripartite composition of man, with a view to bringing all men to the "truth that maketh free!" The book begins with an acclaimed "must-read" prologue, and has six (6) conceptual parts, namely: 1.A New Beginning 2.The Way 3.The Vehicle 4.The Cruise 5.The Crossing 6.Never To Be Forgotten The 1st part ends with a technical innovation to demystify the concept of Human Destiny and simply relates it to conscious envisioning and mission statements. The 2nd part has got another practical innovation--The Balanced Success Map (BSM), which is an attempt to practically guide the reader (or Cruiser) as he translates, most constructively, his current feasible dreams and wishes to some very highly achievable goals. The 3rd part comes with yet another innovation--The Vehicle--Destiny 2.07+ U20x Model, which is arguably the grandest vehicle in town. You just can't wait to acquire it! The 4th part introduces the reader to the practical applications of the already established principles, whereas the 5th part dwells instructively on life after here, which, to me, is the crux of the matter. And just before the closure, the 6th part appears to be asking, "Would you be remembered after dust has become dust?" The overriding implication is that A Fantastic Cruise To The Zenith may not just end at being sold, bought, and read. It may also have to be studied, and read over and over again. My advice is for it to be by your pillow at night, in your bag when on the move, on your table at work and, in your palms at the least o

Bush is the third in Ambassador Untermeyer’s series of books based on his personal journals compiled during his tenure in the service of George H. W. Bush, first as vice president, then as president. The present work begins with Bush’s election in November 1988 and concludes with Untermeyer’s service as director of the Voice of America, from 1991 until Bush’s defeat by Clinton in 1992. Filled with the author’s personal observations and commentary on White House events, personalities, and issues, Zenith is written largely from Untermeyer’s perspective as President Bush’s director of personnel, a position that placed him squarely at the center of the politically charged process of making recommendations on some 3,500 federal appointments.

9781999819118|199981911X|Have you ever questioned how Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck would have went if there was a zombie apocalypse as opposed to the Great Depression? Well, I did. What started as a fun personal project quickly escalated into something bigger. This is a short novella, about half the length of an average book and does not fit into the Among the Dead series. "Originally published in 1937 by John Steinbeck, reimagined and corrupted by Ryan Colley in 2018 for this satirical novella. George Milton, an intelligent and quick witted survivor, and Lennie Small, a physically strong but intellectually challenged childlike individual, are two displaced ranch workers fleeing the apocalypse. Forced to move from place to place, partially due to Lennie's misdeeds and mainly due to the undead roaming the land. They both search for work in a collapsing world in an attempt to buy their own corner of heaven where they will be safe together from the "Sick Ones" and "live off the fatta the lan." For fans of the original novel, apocalypse fiction, or for those looking for something different."

9780691016368|0691016364|Making Mice blends scientific biography, institutional history, and cultural history to show how genetically standardized mice came to play a central role in contemporary American biomedical research. Karen Rader introduces us to mouse "fanciers" who bred mice for different characteristics, to scientific entrepreneurs like geneticist C. C. Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research. It will appeal not only to historians of science but also to biologists and medical researchers.

But one night, their fragile peace is shattered when Shelley wakes to hear a creak on the stairs. Someone has broken into the house . . . In the shocking, chilling events that follow, Shelley’s world is turned on its head, as the women find themselves tested as never before. And as their lives spiral out of control, the tension reaches fever pitch, and Shelley begins to wonder: if she and her mother are not mice after all, then what are they? 'Truly remarkable . . . Mice is a book many will without question be talking about' Daily Express 'A sophisticated psychological thriller . . . gripping' Guardian

9780643099319|064309931X|Australia’s native rodents are the most ecologically diverse family of Australian mammals. There are about 60 living species – all within the subfamily Murinae – representing around 25 per cent of all species of Australian mammals. They range in size from the very small delicate mouse to the highly specialised, arid-adapted hopping mouse, the large tree rat and the carnivorous water rat. Native Mice and Rats describes the evolution and ecology of this much-neglected group of animals. It details the diversity of their reproductive biology, their dietary adaptations and social behaviour. The book also includes information on rodent parasites and diseases, and concludes by outlining the changes in distribution of the various species since the arrival of Europeans as well as current conservation programs.

9780691016368|0691016364|Making Mice blends scientific biography, institutional history, and cultural history to show how genetically standardized mice came to play a central role in contemporary American biomedical research. Karen Rader introduces us to mouse "fanciers" who bred mice for different characteristics, to scientific entrepreneurs like geneticist C. C. Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research. It will appeal not only to historians of science but also to biologists and medical researchers.
